# HSK Chinese Learning & Cultural Resource Platform

> A Project Led by Chinese Teachers of Confucius Institute at University of Lagos

## Project Introduction

This repository hosts a comprehensive Chinese learning platform developed under the leadership of seconded Chinese teachers from the Confucius Institute at University of Lagos. The platform focuses on three core needs: full-stage preparation for HSK Levels 1-6, systematic learning of basic Chinese, and learning of Chinese culture.

Integrating resources from classic textbooks such as *Basic Chinese Course*, the platform covers the entire learning process from zero-based entry to HSK Level 6 exam preparation. Meanwhile, it supplements Chinese cultural knowledge modules to help Chinese learners in Nigeria and worldwide effectively improve their Chinese proficiency and better understand Chinese culture.

## Core Content Modules
